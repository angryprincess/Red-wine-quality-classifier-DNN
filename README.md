# Red-wine-quality-classifier-DNN
The goal of the project is to implement a Red wine quality classifier using a Neural network
I have followed these steps in this project:
    1. Performed EDA, Explored the features using histograms, implemented any data preprocessing required.
    2. Implemented a Neural Network using TF Estimator DNN Classifier
    3. Implemented a Neural Network using TF.Keras
          a. Plot training loss and validation loss
          b. Plot training accuracy and validation accuracy
    4. I have provided observations/reasoning where necessary and a conclusion section at the end of the notebook.
